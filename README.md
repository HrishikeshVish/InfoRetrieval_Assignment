### Team:
* Ashwin R. Bharadwaj
* Hardik Gourisaria
* Hrishikesh V
* K Shrinidhi Bhagavath

### Problem Statement
#### Problem:
a) Build a search engine for Environmental News NLP archieve.
b) Built a corpus for archieve with atleast 418 documents.

#### Data:
a) Use the following link for Environmental News NLP dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/amritvirsinghx/environmental-news-nlp-dataset

### Deliverables: 
Your Code should contain functionality to 
 -Search for the terms in the query
 -Create Postings list
 -Fill the Inverted Index
 -Rank the pages
 -Retrieve the data from the dictionary
 -Query response time 
 -Measure the efficiency using precision,recall,F measure.
 
### Demo:
-Run your code and carryout the search with different queries. 
-Retrieve the data, compile and compare metrics with any one of the search engine  like Elasticsearch, Apache Solr,Apache Lucene, Google Cloud Search, Google Desktop Search for the same corpus.
-Measure the efficiency.

### Report:
-You should submit a hard copy, 4
-page summary of your project 
-Your report should include the code snippet/algorithm used, similarity check of retrieved data obtained with your search engine and any one search engine like Elasticsearch,Apache Solr, Apache Lucene, Google Cloud Search, Google Desktop Search.
-Interpretation of efficiency.
Last para of your report should contain your observations on the Learning Outcomes of this project.
